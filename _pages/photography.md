I like a little bit of amateur photography.
I shoot with a Panasonic Lumix LX100. It is a nice little camera, better than a point and shoot but much smaller than a DSLR. I think they call them 'bridge' cameras, but what do I know!?

They say the best camera, is the one you have with you, well my phone camera is crap. It is the Huawei P20-Lite, and it just processes the images too much, smoothening them and messing them up. The best camera phone I ever had was the Nexus 5. It just kept out of the way and let me take a good photo. I don't understand how camera phone quality has gone backwards so much over the last 5 years.

## Photos

Here are a selection of my photos. I like to take landscapes mostly, but I also have an eye for bright colours and unusual quirky stuff.
