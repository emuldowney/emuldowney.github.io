# Website and Blog

This is my website and blog. It is based upon the Reked theme. A stripped down copy of that readme is given below.


### Reked
Reked is a minimal and responsive blog theme for Jekyll. It is focused on the content, speed, simplicity

### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

## Stackbit

This theme is ready to import into Stackbit. It can be deployed to Netlify and you can connect any headless CMS including Forestry, NetlifyCMS, DatoCMS, Sanity or Contentful.

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the \_posts directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

      ---
      layout: post
      title: "Welcome to Jekyll!"
      date: 2018-08-23 16:04:00 +0300
      image: 03.jpg
      tags: Jekyll
      ---


You can set the tags and the post image.

Add post images to **/images/** directory.

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).
