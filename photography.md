# Photography

I like a little bit of amateur photography.
I shoot with a Panasonic Lumix LX100. It is a nice little camera, better than a point and shoot but much smaller than a DSLR. I think they call them 'bridge' cameras, but what do I know!?

Here are a selection of my photos. I like to take landscapes mostly, but I also have an eye for graffiti and unusual quirky stuff.
