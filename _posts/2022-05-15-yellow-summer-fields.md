# Rapeseed Fields

Early summer brings out the 40 shades of green that Ireland is so famous for. [Rapeseed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed) has become a much more popular plant on farms over the past 20 years. It adds such a vibrant dash of yellow to the landscape. I have wanted to get a lovely photo of rapeseed fields for a few years. The ideal image I envisioned looked quite like the Windows XP [default wallpaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)), only with a large yellow field instead.

This year with a little 6 month old in tow, we spent a week of holidays in [Wexford](https://www.visitwexford.ie/) (the Sunny South-East). Along the journey, I was admiring the rapeseed fields, and decided to take a pitstop on the side of the dual-carriageway. I don't think I got the photo I dreamed of yet, but I quite like these few.
