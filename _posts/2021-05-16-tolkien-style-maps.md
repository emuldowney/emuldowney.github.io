## It all started with a blog post

[Ordinance Survey UK](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/newsroom/blog/real-world-mapping-meets-tolkien) had a guest blog post describing the process of hand-drawing a map in the Lord of the Rings style. Dan Bell draws and sells hand-drawn maps on his website [middleearthmaps.com](https://middleearthsmaps.com/pages/about). His tutorial on Ordinance Survey was very approachable, and easy to replicate. I used [openstreetmaps.org](https://openstreetmaps.org) to get the base level map for my drawing. I find it quite good for showing a mixture of topographic and navigation features, allowing me to easily choose features to draw.
