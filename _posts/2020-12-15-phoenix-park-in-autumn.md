# Escape Dublin on your doorstep

I love spending weekends in the Phoenix Park. Even though located well within the city limits, it is it's own little haven away from the bustling Dublin City. Early on a Sunday morning is particularly nice, while everyone else lies in bed, the serene silence of the Park provides a special getaway from the noisy traffic of the city. Whether it is because it is atop a hill and the sound doesn't travel up to the park, or the trees provide enough baffling, one can easily forget about the rat race that city life sometimes feels like.
The top photo is one that I have been waiting for months to capture. The tree is on the edge of the '50 acres', and feels quite exposed away from any other growth. I didn't get out as early as I would have liked to try capture this, so had to wait for the right moment as others tried to picture their kids and loved ones under the tree. But the outcome was worth the wait.

It is fascinating to watch the different trees shed their leaves at different intervals. While many ash trees were bare, these beech trees were still green. Now in the middle of December they finally have settled into hibernation. This photo captures a lovely autumnal colour in the middle of winter.
The final photo was opportunistic, the sunlight broke through the clouds enough to blindingly shine through and provide this beautiful photograph.
I am now beginning to sell prints of my photos. If you would like to purchase any of these images, please contact me at my email address linked on this site. The images can be printed in various sizes up to 50x70cm. They are an ideal backdrop to a living space, or bedroom, transporting you to the Phoenix Park and beyond.
