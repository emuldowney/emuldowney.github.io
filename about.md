## Eoin Muldowney

I'm an Electronic Engineer based in Dublin, Ireland. 

I have 8+ years experience in the semiconductor design industry, specialising in Design Validation, Measurement, and Test. I have worked on numerous IC products in the Industrial, Scientific, Healthcare, Automotive, and Consumer markets. 

In my spare time, I enjoy watching athletics, and trying my hand at some photography.
